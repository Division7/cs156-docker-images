# cs156-docker-images
This is a repository to store [ucsb-cs156's](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156) base docker images in order to speed up CI/CD. Our projects mostly originate from the same base, and actual development changes generally appear in the last 3 steps.

By precompiling the first 30 or so, we can speed up deployment times significantly.
